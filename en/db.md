# Database
The DB diagram was written in DBML ([Download dbml file](_media/db.dbml ':ignore')) and was automatically tanspiled in PostgreeSQL.

If you want to change the database we recommend you to use the same tool stack. Firstly, [Download the dbml file](_media/db.dbml ':ignore') and import it inside [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website and modify it as you wish. secondly, when you finished, export the new dbml file and transpile it in your favorite SQL database engine using [transpiler tool](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/cli/#installation). Lastly, if you want a well-designed db diagram from your dbml as above, you can use [dbml renderer tool](https://github.com/softwaretechnik-berlin/dbml-renderer)
